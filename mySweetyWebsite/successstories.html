           <b> Pounds lost: 40 </b>
           <p>
               Turning point: My 'freshman 15' was more like the 'freshman 40.' I was a huge emotional eater. I would eat when I was stressed, happy, sad—it didn’t matter. I felt embarrassed trying on clothes when I'd have to secretly ask the sales lady to bring me a larger size. I felt drained from the life that I was leading, and I knew that if I didn’t make a change soon, my weight would continue to balloon and my health would suffer. I am proud to say that I changed my lifestyle by forming great habits and I've never turned back.
           </p>
           <p>
               <b> Weight-loss tip: </b> There is no magic pill or potion for getting fit. I learned this through my own trials and errors until I was finally able to kick bad habits and embrace health and fitness as a lifestyle.

We are so blinded to what a real unposed body looks like and blinded to what beauty is that people would find me less attractive within a 5 second pose switch! How insanely ridiculous is that!?

           <b> Jovana Borojevic: Lost 139 Lbs. </b>
           <p>
               Although she was happy and confident in her body, Jovana Borojevic was shocked when she finally stepped on a scale.
           </p>

           <p>
               I never in my life imagined that I would see a 3 in front of my weight, Borojevic, who hit 304 lbs. and had developed fatty liver disease from her fast food-heavy diet, all while dealing with Polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS, tells PEOPLE. From this day forward, something clicked in me and I changed my life around cold turkey.
           </p>

           <p>
               The digital marketing strategist, now 24, immediately cut out starchy carbs, refined foods, sugar and most packaged food. In a month she dropped almost 20 lbs., and started hitting the gym four to five times a week for weight training and cardio workouts.
           </p>


           <blockquote>It is SO IMPORTANT to focus on non-scale victories like how your clothes fit, how you feel, how many health issues you’ve reversed and saved yourself from and how happy you are! Now a year and a half into her weight loss journey, Borojevic is down to 165 lbs., with a goal weight of about 150 lbs.  </blockquote>

                   <p> Hollywood has an inclusivity problem, and it may not be the one you think.

While shows like House, Scrubs, and Grey’s Anatomy all take place in a medical setting, the illnesses we see characters suffer from on these programs and in other popular TV shows and movies are most commonly what I like to call the big three: cancer, heart attack, and stroke (with the occasional gunshot victim thrown in).

Yet a major and debilitating illness that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates afflicts 30.3 million people is rarely, if ever, represented in this medium: type 2 diabetes. Think about it: Have you ever seen a character prick their finger to inject insulin or count carbs on camera?

The same goes for people behind the camera. It’s rare to hear about a producer, a cameraman or -woman, or a director speaking out about his or her type 2 diabetes. But type 1 diabetes, meanwhile, is often discussed by celebrities: Mary Tyler Moore, Nick Jonas, and Jay Cutler, for example, are all vocal about their diagnoses. The famous individuals with type 2 seem to be nonexistent, except for Tom Hanks, of course.

In a world where art often imitates life, shouldn’t there be more people with type 2 diabetes represented in American pop culture? And what’s the reason they aren’t? </p>
